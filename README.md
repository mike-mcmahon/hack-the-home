# hack-the-home
A neat fix to a nagging problem. 

Constantly leaving the garage door open, and often forgetting to set the alarm at night, I just couldn't handle the heat
from the significant other anymore.... ok, she didn't really didn't come down that hard on me, but hey, why give
her another reason to scold me...lol.

Inspired by the hacker-scripts repo, I created a solution taking advantage of the Twilio API and services.  I used a Raspberry Pi
and iterfaced it with my existing ADT Security system, did a little networking, connected to my server, and voila!

I plan to do further projects in the home using the Twilio services and more Pi's.  I weclome suggestions and ideas.

Cheers!

Mike
